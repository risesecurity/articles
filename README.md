* [Dynamic Program Analysis and Software Exploitation](https://github.com/risesecurity/articles/raw/HEAD/p67_0x0a.txt)  
  This article discusses the use of backward taint analysis to determine the exploitability of vulnerabilities. All examples presented on this article were developed and executed on an x86-64 processor-based computer running Microsoft Windows 7. Previous knowledge of vulnerability analysis and exploitation is required.

* [Hacking the Cell Broadband Engine Architecture](https://github.com/risesecurity/articles/raw/HEAD/p66_0x0d.txt)  
  This article discusses software development and vulnerability exploitation in Power/Cell Broadband Engine Architecture's Synergistic Processor Element (SPE). All examples presented on this article were developed and executed using the IBM Full-System Simulator 3.0 for the Cell Broadband Engine Processor for Intel (64-bit), on an x86-64 processor-based computer running on Fedora 7 with the IBM SDK for Multicore Acceleration 3.0. Previous knowledge of vulnerability analysis and exploitation is required.

* [Linux on Power/Cell BE Architecture Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities](https://github.com/risesecurity/articles/raw/HEAD/lopbuffer.pdf)  
  This article discusses buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Linux running on Power/Cell Broadband Engine Architecture processor-based servers. All examples presented on this article were developed and executed on an IBM BladeCenter JS22 Express server, a IBM BladeCenter QS21 server, and a Sony Playstation 3, running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Update 7. Previous knowledge of buffer overflows is required.

* [Linux Slab Allocator Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities](https://github.com/risesecurity/articles/raw/HEAD/linuxslab.pdf)  
  This article discusses buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Linux kernel's Slab Allocator. All examples presented on this article were developed and executed on a x86 processor-based computer running Slackware Linux 10.2. Previous knowledge of buffer overflows is required.

* [System Management Mode Hacks](https://github.com/risesecurity/articles/raw/HEAD/p65_0x07.txt)  
  This article discusses the use of Intel System Management Mode (SMM) for malicious purposes. All examples presented on this article were developed and executed on an x86 processor-based computer running Debian 4.0r3 (Etch). Previous knowledge of x86 architecture is required.
